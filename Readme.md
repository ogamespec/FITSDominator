# FITS Dominator

FITS is a standard file format for exchanging astronomical data. (https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/)

Existing programs for working with FITS are not suitable. We make our own.

## Why existing programs do not suit

### SAOImage9

- Inconvenient and overburned interface with a bunch of menus and submenus
- There is no way to load your tables
- There is no way to add a celestial coordinate grid by anchor points
- RMB instead of panning does color scaling (very annoying)
- No hierarchical structures support

### FITS Liberator

- A lot of unneded extra information and logos on the main form
- No grid
- There is no way to load your tables
- There is no way to maximize the window
- No hierarchical structures support

## Why Dominator?

Ensemples the naming tradition started by the FITS Liberator. At first I wanted to name this program FITS Nagibator, but I thought that it would be too much.
